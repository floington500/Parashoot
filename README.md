# Parashoot

Hosting your own content delivery network is one of the best things you could do to protect your files that you send
online.

## Motive

Nowadays, companies are more invasive than ever when it comes to your personal data and how it is managed. When it comes
to [Content Delivery](https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/content-delivery), are you really going to trust
them with the files you send online?

Platforms such as Instagram and Facebook will regularly cache your messages in their own content delivery networks so 
that they can build profiles on you and sell data to other shareholders. After all, do you really think they would
provide these services for free? 

Once you upload a file through a media platform, it will forever be stored in their databases and there is nothing you
can do about it. A common misconception is that deleting the message erases everything, but 
[Data Tombstoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tombstone_(data_store)) is a practice regularly implemented to log
everything that is deleted along with a one-to-one copy of the file.

## Solution

Hosting your own content delivery service is the optimal ways to protect the files from big media companies. This is
done by hosting your own files so that they are not uploaded to the content delivery networks owned by big media
companies.

Having your own content delivery service lets you take back the ownership of the files that you send online, allowing
you to delete the files knowing that big media companies are not also stealing a copy for themselves.
