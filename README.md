# Parashoot

With the problem of companies being incresingly less trustworthy, Parashoot *aims* to grant users a sense of ownership over their content.

## Motive

### Social Media

Companies are more invasive than ever when it comes to respecting the privacy of its users. When it comes
to [Content Delivery](https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/content-delivery), this is where corperation are able to catch the most for every net they cast.

Platforms such as Instagram and Facebook regularly cache the files you send on their platforms in their own databases so that they can build profiles on you and sell data to other shareholders. After all, do you really think they would provide these services for free? 

The moment you click the send button on a message containing a file, it is no longer yours. A common misconception is that deleting the message with the file erases the entry from the database, but 
[Data Tombstoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tombstone_(data_store)) is a practice regularly implemented to store private copies of files that are deleted in order to enforce as much control on the user.

### Cloud Storage

It is becoming increasingly more common over time for big data centers that provide cloud storage to mistreat your data
in a variety of ways. With thousands of people's data to handle in such dense conditions, how could they possibly take
good care of everything?

A good example of this is a [recent incident](https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606/google-drive-files-suddenly-disappeared-the-drive-literally-went-back-to-condition-in-may-2023?hl=en) 
with **Google Drive**, where they lost months worth's of people's data with no trace of anything left behind. Google 
responded by deleting people's posts in an attempt to silence the issue, while the community manager responded with a 
useless solution. 

## Solution

Hosting your own content delivery service is a great way to protect your files while ensuring that they are in good hands. Not using the content delivery networks provided by big media companies, provides you with an extra layer of protection and allows you to take control back.
